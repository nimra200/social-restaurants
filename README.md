# About the Project
The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the local restaurant industry due to regional lockdowns. Consequently, many restaurants lost customers and are struggling to run their businesses. We have created a social media platform called *Restify* where restaurants post their information and engage with new customers by creating blog posts. Customers can leave behind comments and reviews for restaurants, and "follow" or "like" their favourite food spots. 

## Running the website 
In the terminal, type the following commands:


`$ git clone https://github.com/nimra200/social-restaurants.git`


`$ cd social-restaurants/`


`$ source startup.sh`


`$ source run.sh `

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see the following homepage:
